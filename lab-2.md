# Lab 2: Build a Simple AI Agent

## Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to build a simple AI Agent that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans. This AI Agent leverages Azure AI services to analyze and visualize data efficiently.

## Objective
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a Simple AI Agent

## Task 1: Create a Simple AI Agent

In this task, you will build a simple AI Agent that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans using Azure AI services for analysis and visualization.

1. Open the **Lab 2 - Create A Simple AI Agent.ipynb** file. This **Lab 2 - Create A Simple AI Agent.ipynb** notebook guides you through how to build a simple AI Agent that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans.

1. Run the next cell to create an AIProjectClient instance that connects to your Microsoft Foundry project using the project endpoint from environment variables and Azure token-based authentication. This establishes a secure programmatic connection to your project resources without hardcoding credentials.

1. Run the next cell to create a **simple AI Agent** that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans using Microsoft Foundry. This script initializes the AI agent, sends a prompt containing health plan data, and requests a bar chart. The agent processes the request, generates the chart, saves the image file, and then cleans up by deleting the agent.

1. Observe the resulting output chart by opening the **health-plan-comparison.png** file. This visualizes the comparison of health benefit plans based on the input data.
